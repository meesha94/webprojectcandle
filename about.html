            Amal Candles is a daughter and father duo, although all members of the family tend to help out picking which scents are the best for you all to buy! The best part is that we both have such a passion that we work extremely hard to make sure the final product you buy is perfect. We have spent many days and nights making test candles to make sure our customers are excited to use an Amal candle.

    <h3 class="subheading">Our Story</h3>
            <p class="answers">
                Whilst making more of an effort to be enviornmentally friendly, the founders of Amal Candles started to look at the candles they had been using and felt like they needed to look for a more enviornmentally friednly candle. After finding out about how harmful traditional parrafin wax candles are when you burn and how the process to obtain parrafin wax is harmful to environment, they looked to alernatives. Whilst soy wax was labelled as a great alternative,as it gives a clean burn, reseraching further into soy wax found that once again the process of obtaning soy wax is harmful to the environment. They then found rapeseed wax was the best wax they could use as it gave a clean burn but the process of obtaining the wax was great for the enviornment. It even helps the bees, as they love the nectar from the rapeseed flower and the carbon footprint is low as it is produced locally all over the UK. 
                Unfortuetly there are few rapeseed candle options about and those on the market all have similar earthy scents. We wanted rapeseed candle but with a variety of different scents, such as; fruity, floral, seasonal, food scents and many more and so Amal Candles was born!
